# e-commerce-back-end

## Description 

The motivation behind building the e-commerce website back end was to manage the company's data and streamline operations.

By utilizing the latest technologies, including Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL, the project ensures a functional API that seamlessly connects to a well-structured database. This not only facilitates easy database management but also provides a foundation for robust API routes, enabling the manager to handle essential operations such as fetching, updating, and deleting data efficiently.

Through this project, I learned about the integration of Express.js and Sequelize to create a powerful back end for web applications. I gained insights into database management, including schema creation, seeding, and synchronization with Sequelize. Additionally, testing and debugging API routes in tools like Insomnia enhanced my understanding of the importance of thorough testing in the development process. Overall, the project enhanced my knowledge of full-stack development.
